## ü§ñ What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is a system that perceives its environment, processes information, and takes actions to achieve a goal. It often uses **machine learning** or **rule-based logic** to make decisions and act intelligently.  
Examples:
- Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT)
- Recommendation engines (e.g., Netflix)
- Automated workflow bots

The workflow listens for incoming chat messages using the **When chat message received** node.  
The message is sent to the **AI Agent**, which uses the **Groq Chat Model** to generate a response and the **Simple Memory** node to remember previous messages.  
When a user asks something (e.g., *Who is the Prime Minister of India?*), the workflow replies with a complete answer, leveraging both the AI model and memory.  
This demonstrates how you can use **n8n + AI Agent + Memory** to create intelligent conversational bots with little to no coding.

- **Database Trigger** - Record modifications

#### Regular Nodes
Perform specific actions within the workflow sequence.

**Essential Regular Nodes:**
- **HTTP Request** - API interactions
- **Set** - Data manipulation and formatting
- **Switch** - Conditional routing
- **Function** - Custom JavaScript execution
- **Merge** - Data combination from multiple sources

**Node Anatomy:**
- **Parameters Panel** - Configuration options
- **Input/Output Data** - Data flow visualization
- **Credentials** - Authentication management
- **Error Handling** - Failure response configuration

### 2.2 Essential Core Nodes

#### HTTP Request Node
The cornerstone for API integrations and web service interactions.

**Configuration Options:**

- **Request Methods** - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
- **Headers Management** - Custom headers and content types
- **Body Formats** - JSON, Form Data, Raw, Binary
- **Response Processing** - Data extraction and transformation

**Best Practices:**
- Implement proper error handling
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Add retry logic for unstable APIs
- Document API endpoints and expected responses

#### Set (Edit Fields) Node
Primary tool for data manipulation and formatting.

**Core Functions:**
- **Add/Remove Fields** - Structure data output
- **Data Type Conversion** - String, number, boolean transformations
- **Field Renaming** - Standardize data formats
- **Conditional Logic** - Dynamic field values
- **Array Processing** - Handle multiple data items

#### Function Node
Enables custom JavaScript for advanced data processing.

**Use Cases:**
- Complex mathematical calculations
- Custom data validation
- External library integration
- Advanced string manipulation
- Date/time processing

**JavaScript Environment:**
```javascript
// Access input data
const inputData = $input.all();

// Process data
const processedData = inputData.map(item => ({
  ...item.json,
  processedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  calculatedValue: item.json.value * 1.2
}));

// Return formatted output
return processedData;
```

### 2.3 Data Transformation Mastery

**Understanding n8n Data Structure**

n8n processes data in JSON format, with each workflow execution handling arrays of objects containing the actual data payload and metadata.

**Data Structure Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "json": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "form_submission",
        "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

**Navigation Techniques:**

- **Dot Notation:** `{{ $json.metadata.source }}`
- **Array Access:** `{{ $json.items[0].name }}`
- **Conditional Access:** `{{ $json.user?.profile?.email || 'No email' }}`
- **Expression Functions:** `{{ $json.created_at.toDateTime().plus({days: 30}) }}`

**Advanced Transformations:**
- Data filtering and sorting
- Aggregation and grouping
- Format conversions
- Validation and cleaning
