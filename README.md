## ü§ñ What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is a system that perceives its environment, processes information, and takes actions to achieve a goal. It often uses **machine learning** or **rule-based logic** to make decisions and act intelligently.  
Examples:
- Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT)
- Recommendation engines (e.g., Netflix)
- Automated workflow bots

## üî∑ What is n8n?

**n8n** is a powerful **workflow automation tool** that allows you to automate tasks and integrate APIs without much coding. It features:
- No-code/low-code interface
- Flexible workflows
- Integrations with OpenAI, LangChain, and many more

This makes it an ideal platform to build **AI-powered automation workflows**.

The workflow listens for incoming chat messages using the **When chat message received** node.  
The message is sent to the **AI Agent**, which uses the **Groq Chat Model** to generate a response and the **Simple Memory** node to remember previous messages.  
When a user asks something (e.g., *Who is the Prime Minister of India?*), the workflow replies with a complete answer, leveraging both the AI model and memory.  
This demonstrates how you can use **n8n + AI Agent + Memory** to create intelligent conversational bots with little to no coding.
